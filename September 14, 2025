This is my mean of finding meaning in my 
Life. Also the beginning of writing 
something like a diary with random 
topics and my love for ideas.


Today, is my sibling's birthday and me, 
family, relatives, and relatives'neighbor 
went to OPPA K GRILL which is sanggyupsal
and it is really such a memorable moments.

There was disastrous moments and that's
why it's so funny, memorable, and shocking.
I laugh at how clumsy my cousins are like
spilling water in the chicken and make it
really look like Adobo, also about 
"tumatalsik na mantika" it's really scary
and funny watching the reactions of
overreacting in just getting the beef lol.

Well there's this mystery for me, like
there are two same stoves but one stove is
too oily like where does the oil come from
and the other one which is so dry.

Anyways, it was a fun day today and I enjoy
everything.
